# Higher-Order Component (HOC)

A Higher-Order Component is a design pattern used in component-based frameworks like React. It refers to a function that takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component with additional functionalities or props. HOCs are used for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns, and enhancing the behavior of components without modifying their original source code. They enable the composition of components and allow you to add functionality, such as logging, authentication, or state management, to multiple components without duplicating code.
